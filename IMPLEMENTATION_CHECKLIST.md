# Design & Implementation Plan: `arc_universal_constructor.py`

## 1. Project Philosophy & Goal

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for `arc_universal_constructor.py`. Unlike a simple pattern-matching solver, this system is designed to be a true, learnable **Von Neumann Universal Constructor (vNUC)**.

Its core philosophy is the separation of the **"brain"** (a neural controller that writes programs) from the **"body"** (a spatial environment that executes those programs). The goal is to create a system that learns to solve ARC-AGI-2 tasks by generating and executing explicit, interpretable construction programs, demonstrating principles of self-repair, abstraction, and constructor-completeness as laid out in the initial research plan.

**Key Principle:** Following Von Neumann's vision - minimal fixed machinery with maximal generality. Complex behaviors emerge from neural learning to compose simple primitives, not from hardcoded operations.

## 2. Architectural Comparison: Baseline vs. Target

To clarify the required implementation, we first contrast the simple `arc_unified.py` baseline with the target architecture for `arc_universal_constructor.py`.

| Feature | `arc_unified.py` (Simple Baseline) | `arc_universal_constructor.py` (Target Architecture) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Philosophy** | **Pattern Generator:** An end-to-end differentiable model that maps a task embedding to a final grid. | **Programmable Agent:** A system that separates program synthesis from physical execution. |
| **Controller Role** | **Decoder:** The Transformer decodes a latent vector into pixel logits for the entire grid in one shot. | **Policy Network:** The Transformer acts as a policy `π(action|state)`, generating a sequence of opcodes (a program). |
| **Execution Model** | **Implicit & One-Shot:** A single forward pass produces the final state. No concept of space or time. | **Explicit & Iterative:** A loop where the controller decides an action, and a separate environment executes it spatially on a grid over time. |
| **Training Paradigm** | **Supervised Learning:** `CrossEntropyLoss` between predicted pixels and target pixels. Fully differentiable. | **Reinforcement Learning:** Policy gradient (e.g., REINFORCE) based on a terminal reward (e.g., IoU of the final constructed grid). |
| **Abstraction** | **Implicit:** Learned patterns are stored opaquely in the Transformer's weights. | **Explicit:** A `MacroLibrary` stores named, reusable subroutines (sequences of opcodes), discovered via a DreamCoder-like process. |
| **Interpretability** | **Black Box:** Reasoning is hidden in attention weights. Debugging is limited to numerical stability. | **Glass Box:** The generated program (blueprint) is an explicit artifact. The construction process can be visualized step-by-step. |

## 4. Development Log

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)**

**2024-12-28 - Steps A-1, A-2, A-3, K-2: Infrastructure Setup**

**Completed:**
- ✅ Single-file CLI script with comprehensive argument parsing
- ✅ Automatic ARC-AGI-2 dataset download and extraction  
- ✅ PyTorch Dataset wrapper with proper JSON parsing
- ✅ Full hyperparameter exposure via CLI arguments

**Key Technical Insights:**
1. **ARC-AGI-2 Dataset Structure:** The dataset uses `data/training/` and `data/evaluation/` subdirectories, not direct `training/` and `evaluation/` folders as initially assumed.

2. **JSON Format Correction:** ARC tasks structure test data as `{"input": [...], "output": [...]}` objects rather than direct array access. This required updating the `load_task()` function to properly parse `raw["test"][0]["input"]` and `raw["test"][0]["output"]`.

3. **CLI Design Philosophy:** Exposed all architectural parameters upfront to enable rapid experimentation without code modification. This includes GNCA steps, memory tokens, transformer architecture, damage simulation, and visualization flags.

4. **Memory Requirements:** User prefers GPU-optimized dashboards and compute shaders over CPU-bound approaches for performance.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ 4/4 foundational infrastructure components complete
- ✅ Script successfully loads 1000 training tasks and 120 evaluation tasks  
- ✅ All CLI modes (train/eval/demo) functional with proper argument handling

**Performance Verified:**
- Dataset loading: ✅ ARCDataset('train') → 1000 tasks, ARCDataset('eval') → 120 tasks
- CLI functionality: ✅ All arguments parsed and displayed correctly
- Demo mode output example:
  ```
  [Demo] Von Neumann Universal Constructor for ARC-AGI-2
  [Demo] Dataset contains: • 1000 training tasks • 120 evaluation tasks

- ✅ Comprehensive debug prints and numerical stability verification
- ✅ Performance optimization meeting all constraints

**Key Technical Insights:**
1. **Architecture Optimization:** Initial design (16 channels, 128-unit MLP) exceeded parameter budget (19,392 > 15k). Optimized to 8 channels and 64-unit MLP achieving 3,008 parameters.

2. **Performance Profiling:** CUDA initialization overhead caused apparent 100ms+ timing. After warmup, achieved 0.33ms average (well under 0.5ms target). Critical to benchmark after GPU warmup for accurate measurements.

3. **Adaptive Grid Sizing:** Instead of always processing 30×30 grids, dynamically size processing to actual grid dimensions (minimum 8×8 for stable convolution). Major performance improvement for small ARC grids.

4. **Numerical Stability:** GNCA evolution shows stable convergence: mean activations evolve from -0.0038 to -0.0059 over 8 steps. Tanh activation prevents exploding gradients. Xavier initialization ensures stable startup.

**Performance Verified:**
- Parameters: ✅ 3,008 << 15,000 target
- Timing: ✅ 0.33ms average ≤ 0.5ms target (RTX 4080 SUPER) 
- Stability: ✅ No NaN/Inf, consistent activation evolution

  [GNCA] after step 0 → mean -0.0038
  [GNCA] after step 7 → mean -0.0059
  [GNCA] Encoding complete: torch.Size([1, 64]) in 96.18ms

   - Reducing embedding dimension: 128 → 96 (25% reduction)
   - Result: 306,144 parameters (<<700k target, 62% reduction)

3. **Memory Token Architecture:** 6 learnable memory tokens serve as persistent scratchpad across reasoning steps. Memory tokens properly integrate with task embeddings through concatenation and transformer processing.

4. **Numerical Stability:** Controller outputs stable memory representations (mean ≈ 0.0, std ≈ 1.0). Attention block means evolve stably across layers (-0.0192 → 0.1336). Xavier initialization ensures stable startup.

**Performance Verified:**

- Numerical stability: ✅ No NaN/Inf in action logits or memory representations

**Demo Output Verification:**
```
[PC=0] SET_REG: R0 = 10
[PC=1] WRITE[0] at (0, 0): BLUE (color=1)
[PC=2] MOVE_ARM[0] at (0, 1): dx=1, dy=0
[PC=3] DEC_REG: R0 = 9 (was 10)

## 5. Critical Improvements for ARC Performance

### **Context: What ARC Tasks Actually Require**

ARC tasks frequently involve:
- **Pattern repetition**: Copying patterns N times where N varies by input
- **Object manipulation**: Moving, rotating, scaling discrete objects
- **Conditional operations**: Different actions based on cell colors/states
- **Spatial relationships**: Finding corners, edges, centers, boundaries
- **Pattern completion**: Filling missing parts based on observed rules
- **Symmetry operations**: Mirror, rotate, flip transformations
- **Color transformations**: Systematic color replacements or mappings
- **Relative positioning**: Placing objects relative to others
- **Counting and grouping**: Detecting connected components, counting objects

Current limitations preventing effective ARC solving:
- No loops/branching → cannot handle variable repetition
- Hardcoded movement → cannot efficiently navigate to targets
- No parameters → every action is atomic, leading to very long programs
- Poor reward signal → IoU too coarse for precise patterns
- No curriculum → wastes time on impossible tasks
- Pure RL → extremely sample inefficient
