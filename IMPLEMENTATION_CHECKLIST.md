# Design & Implementation Plan: `arc_universal_constructor.py`

## 1. Project Philosophy & Goal

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for `arc_universal_constructor.py`. Unlike a simple pattern-matching solver, this system is designed to be a true, learnable **Von Neumann Universal Constructor (vNUC)**.

Its core philosophy is the separation of the **"brain"** (a neural controller that writes programs) from the **"body"** (a spatial environment that executes those programs). The goal is to create a system that learns to solve ARC-AGI-2 tasks by generating and executing explicit, interpretable construction programs, demonstrating principles of self-repair, abstraction, and constructor-completeness as laid out in the initial research plan.

## 2. Architectural Comparison: Baseline vs. Target

To clarify the required implementation, we first contrast the simple `arc_unified.py` baseline with the target architecture for `arc_universal_constructor.py`.

| Feature | `arc_unified.py` (Simple Baseline) | `arc_universal_constructor.py` (Target Architecture) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Philosophy** | **Pattern Generator:** An end-to-end differentiable model that maps a task embedding to a final grid. | **Programmable Agent:** A system that separates program synthesis from physical execution. |
| **Controller Role** | **Decoder:** The Transformer decodes a latent vector into pixel logits for the entire grid in one shot. | **Policy Network:** The Transformer acts as a policy `π(action|state)`, generating a sequence of opcodes (a program). |
| **Execution Model** | **Implicit & One-Shot:** A single forward pass produces the final state. No concept of space or time. | **Explicit & Iterative:** A loop where the controller decides an action, and a separate environment executes it spatially on a grid over time. |
| **Training Paradigm** | **Supervised Learning:** `CrossEntropyLoss` between predicted pixels and target pixels. Fully differentiable. | **Reinforcement Learning:** Policy gradient (e.g., REINFORCE) based on a terminal reward (e.g., IoU of the final constructed grid). |
| **Abstraction** | **Implicit:** Learned patterns are stored opaquely in the Transformer's weights. | **Explicit:** A `MacroLibrary` stores named, reusable subroutines (sequences of opcodes), discovered via a DreamCoder-like process. |
| **Interpretability** | **Black Box:** Reasoning is hidden in attention weights. Debugging is limited to numerical stability. | **Glass Box:** The generated program (blueprint) is an explicit artifact. The construction process can be visualized step-by-step. |

## 4. Development Log

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)**

**2024-12-28 - Steps A-1, A-2, A-3, K-2: Infrastructure Setup**

**Completed:**
- ✅ Single-file CLI script with comprehensive argument parsing
- ✅ Automatic ARC-AGI-2 dataset download and extraction  
- ✅ PyTorch Dataset wrapper with proper JSON parsing
- ✅ Full hyperparameter exposure via CLI arguments

**Key Technical Insights:**
1. **ARC-AGI-2 Dataset Structure:** The dataset uses `data/training/` and `data/evaluation/` subdirectories, not direct `training/` and `evaluation/` folders as initially assumed.

2. **JSON Format Correction:** ARC tasks structure test data as `{"input": [...], "output": [...]}` objects rather than direct array access. This required updating the `load_task()` function to properly parse `raw["test"][0]["input"]` and `raw["test"][0]["output"]`.

3. **CLI Design Philosophy:** Exposed all architectural parameters upfront to enable rapid experimentation without code modification. This includes GNCA steps, memory tokens, transformer architecture, damage simulation, and visualization flags.

4. **Memory Requirements:** User prefers GPU-optimized dashboards and compute shaders over CPU-bound approaches for performance.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ 4/4 foundational infrastructure components complete
- ✅ Script successfully loads 1000 training tasks and 120 evaluation tasks  
- ✅ All CLI modes (train/eval/demo) functional with proper argument handling

**Performance Verified:**
- Dataset loading: ✅ ARCDataset('train') → 1000 tasks, ARCDataset('eval') → 120 tasks
- CLI functionality: ✅ All arguments parsed and displayed correctly
- Demo mode output example:
  ```
  [Demo] Von Neumann Universal Constructor for ARC-AGI-2
  [Demo] Dataset contains: • 1000 training tasks • 120 evaluation tasks

- ✅ Comprehensive debug prints and numerical stability verification
- ✅ Performance optimization meeting all constraints

**Key Technical Insights:**
1. **Architecture Optimization:** Initial design (16 channels, 128-unit MLP) exceeded parameter budget (19,392 > 15k). Optimized to 8 channels and 64-unit MLP achieving 3,008 parameters.

2. **Performance Profiling:** CUDA initialization overhead caused apparent 100ms+ timing. After warmup, achieved 0.33ms average (well under 0.5ms target). Critical to benchmark after GPU warmup for accurate measurements.

3. **Adaptive Grid Sizing:** Instead of always processing 30×30 grids, dynamically size processing to actual grid dimensions (minimum 8×8 for stable convolution). Major performance improvement for small ARC grids.

4. **Numerical Stability:** GNCA evolution shows stable convergence: mean activations evolve from -0.0038 to -0.0059 over 8 steps. Tanh activation prevents exploding gradients. Xavier initialization ensures stable startup.

**Performance Verified:**
- Parameters: ✅ 3,008 << 15,000 target
- Timing: ✅ 0.33ms average ≤ 0.5ms target (RTX 4080 SUPER) 
- Stability: ✅ No NaN/Inf, consistent activation evolution
- Debug output example:

   - Reducing MLP ratio: 4 → 2 (halved feedforward layer size)
   - Reducing embedding dimension: 128 → 96 (25% reduction)
   - Result: 306,144 parameters (<<700k target, 62% reduction)

3. **Memory Token Architecture:** 6 learnable memory tokens serve as persistent scratchpad across reasoning steps. Memory tokens properly integrate with task embeddings through concatenation and transformer processing.

4. **Numerical Stability:** Controller outputs stable memory representations (mean ≈ 0.0, std ≈ 1.0). Attention block means evolve stably across layers (-0.0192 → 0.1336). Xavier initialization ensures stable startup.

**Performance Verified:**
- Parameters: ✅ 309,152 << 700,000 target (56% under budget)

  [Attn] PyTorch attention: input_shape=torch.Size([1, 7, 96])
  [Attn] block-0 out mean -0.0192
  [Controller] Output memory shape: torch.Size([1, 6, 96])

- ✅ TokenController action head outputting logits over ConstructorOps + macros
- ✅ Iterative blueprint generation with temperature sampling and HALT termination
- ✅ BlueprintInterpreter with SpatialConstructor for non-differentiable execution
- ✅ Complete pipeline: GNCA → TokenController → Blueprint → SpatialConstructor

**Key Technical Insights:**
1. **Action Head Architecture:** TokenController now outputs (action_logits, memory_tokens) tuple instead of just memory. Action head produces logits over dynamically expandable vocabulary (base ops + macros).

2. **Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion:** MacroLibrary enables runtime addition of new operations. Action head automatically expands from 6→7 dimensions when macros added, with proper device placement (CUDA/CPU) handling.

3. **Iterative Reasoning Loop:** `generate_blueprint()` method implements policy π(action|state) with temperature sampling. Properly terminates on HALT opcode (id=5) and respects max_steps limit.

4. **Spatial Execution:** SpatialConstructor manages 30×30 canvas and ConstructionArm objects. BlueprintInterpreter bridges neural (differentiable) and spatial (non-differentiable) components cleanly.

**Performance Verified:**
- Blueprint generation: ✅ 4-step program [WRITE, ERASE, BRANCH_IF_EMPTY, HALT] generated successfully
- Vocabulary expansion: ✅ 6→7 action space with no shape errors after macro addition  
- Execution pipeline: ✅ Step-by-step logging `[Step 0] Arm 0 at (0,0) executing: WRITE(BLUE)`
- Device handling: ✅ CUDA tensors maintained throughout action head expansion
- Numerical stability: ✅ No NaN/Inf in action logits or memory representations

**Demo Output Verification:**
```
[Controller] Generating step 1: WRITE (id=1)
[Controller] Generating step 2: ERASE (id=2)  
[Controller] Generating step 3: BRANCH_IF_EMPTY (id=3)
[Controller] Generating step 4: HALT (id=5)
